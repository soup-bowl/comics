Sorry for this being late, I spent 2 days trying to install Flash in a VM on Linux. It worked eventually.

Flash can't handle animated PNG's so this is the result, I will look into an external PNG animator because... well GIF quality is pretty poor. Uploaded an animated PNG version.

Also I am not sure what to call this daily webcomic, any suggestions are welcome. I am thinking of calling it 'Dimwit Theory'.
